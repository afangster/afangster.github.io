  abstract={Although surgeries involving anastomosis are relatively common, anastomotic leakages are potentially deadly complications of colorectal surgeries due to increased risk of morbidity and mortality. As a result of the potentially fatal effects of anastomotic leakages, a myriad of techniques and treatments have been developed to treat these unfortunate cases. In order to better understand the steps taken to treat this complication, we have created a composite review involving some of the current and best treatments for colonic anastomotic leakage that are available. The aim of this article is to present a background review of colonic anastomotic leakage, as well as current strategies to prevent and treat this condition, for a broader audience, including scientist, engineers, and especially biomedical engineers.},
